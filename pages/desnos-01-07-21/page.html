            Dynamic neural network is an emerging research topic in deep learning. Compared to static models which have
            fixed computational graphs and parameters at the inference stage, dynamic networks can adapt their
            structures or parameters to different inputs, leading to notable advantages in terms of accuracy,
            computational efficiency, adaptiveness, etc. In this survey, we comprehensively review this rapidly
            developing area by dividing dynamic networks into three main categories: 1) instance-wise dynamic models
            that process each instance with data-dependent architectures or parameters; 2) spatial-wise dynamic networks
            that conduct adaptive computation with respect to different spatial locations of image data and 3)
            temporal-wise dynamic models that perform adaptive inference along the temporal dimension for sequential
            data such as videos and texts. The important research problems of dynamic networks, e.g., architecture
            design, decision making scheme, optimization technique and applications, are reviewed systematically.
            Finally, we discuss the open problems in this field together with interesting future research directions
